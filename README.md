# Hi there, I'm Yehudiel👋🏽 
A thousand keystrokes later and I finally managed to create my README profile correctly haha.

But well, back to the "Who am I?" topic. 
- I'm a 20 year old girl, who likes to dance a lot (even though I'm currently on hiatus).
- Software was something I got to see in high school. It was really a little glimpse with html codes, maybe something very basic but at that time for me it was something interesting, I think I started to be interested thanks to a friend because he helped me a lot to make projects and the results (of the projects) were amazing😅
- I also like to eat (who doesn't), and sleep (wd x2)🤣
- I like to watch series, there was a time I saw one where they made desserts and sculptures made of cake and/or chocolate; and currently I'm waiting for the 4th season of a series called "The Chosen", it's based on the new testament of the Bible, the truth is that watching it you'll experience lots  of emotions, I recommend it for those who are just getting to know biblical passages 🦋
- Finally, although I have been interested in the world of software a little bit "late", I will do my part to always keep learning so that I can make a change in the world 🙏🏽✨
